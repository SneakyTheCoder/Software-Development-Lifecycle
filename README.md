**Sprint Review Retrospective**

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program begins with understanding the problem from the user or clients perspective rather than jumping towards solutions. This usually involves gathing input through interviews, observations, feedback, analytics, or stakeholder discussions to identify what users are trying to accomplish, the challenges they face, and the value they expect. After these details are ironed out, they can be used to create user stories. These user stories help by converting the users needs into small manageable tasks that can be prioritized by the team. Allowing the team to only focus on tasks that are bringing value to the user and client.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Incremental building is always the best approach. Building incrementally and staying focused on the users needs and business goals is a great way to ensure you are building valuable systems and consistently reaching the projects goals. I plan to incorporate this incremental developement behavior in my future projects so that I can remain focused and client driven in my next projects.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member on a software development team means that you are contributing not only technical skills but also collaboration, accountability, and keeping a postiive mindset towards the shared goals. A strong team member communicates clearly and respectfully, shares progress updates and challenges openly, and listens to ohers ideas and feedback. This helps the team identify issues early and maker better decisions together rather than working alone and relyings on ones own knowledge.
